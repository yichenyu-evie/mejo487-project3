These industries above are ranked descending by the gap of median weekly earnings between female and male, and only top ten of them are selected to display. The gender pay gap of fianance and insurance industry is the largest, which is 577 U.S. dollars.

            <div><p>This statistic shows the female to male earnings ratio in the U.S. from 2000 to 2019, based on earnings in 2019 CPI-U-RS adjusted dollars. The ratio in 2019 was at 82.3 percent, which indicates that a regular female worker earns about 82 percent of the amount a male employee in the same position would receive. Though the ratio shows a trend of growing, it grows in a very slow pace. After almost 20 years from 2000, the ratio grows less than 10%. It's unreasonable that a woman who is doing the same job as a man, with the exact same qualifications as a man is still paid two percent less for no attributable reason.</p></div>

The graph sorts in ascending order that the gender pay gap for Hispanic or Latino is the smallest while the gender pay gap for black or African American is the largest. In black or African American, male earns around 332 U.S. dollars  more than female weekly. However, when counted both race and gender as factors, the largest pay gap is between Asian male and Hispanic or Latino female.  </p></div>

For example, in 2019, Vermont had the highest earnings ratio for women as female workers earned 91.03 percent of their male counterparts on average. The pay gap varies from state to state, too – often because of those individual states' economies as well as the laws those states have in place to discourage and punish wage discrimination.  </p></div>
